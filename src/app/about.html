<h4>This app was built using the following concepts from Angular 2:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Routing (provided by the Activated Route, Router, and Params components which is used in the Master/Detail view)
    </li>
    <li>
        Modules (containing the needed components for http requests, among other features)
    </li>
    <li>
        Services (custom service written to retrieve data from a local .json file)
    </li>
    <li>
        Dependency Injection (to allow our custom data service to be used by modules/components throughout the app)
    </li>
    <li>
        Components and Templates (four main components that encapsulate the logic, view (templates) and styles for each section of the app and keep them isolated)
    </li>
    <li>
        Observables (used in the data retrieval service so that our views will update whenever new data is received from the external source)
    </li>
    <li>
        Decorators: Injectable, Component, NgModule functions are used to add important meta-data to our classes, turning them into components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Class syntax to create custom object types (FoodItem type is made available by exporting the custom FoodItem class)
    </li>
    <li>
        Views (child views to display the food list (master and detail) and this about page)
    </li>
    <li>
        Data-binding: One way binding of click events (HTML to JS app).
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Additionally, the styles use:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Skeleton CSS framework (a light-weight CSS framwork containing a grid and various button and form styles)
    </li>
    <li>
        Normalize CSS (included with Skeleton)
    </li>
    <li>
        Imported <strong>Raleway</strong> font from Google.
    </li>
    <li>
        Custom styles for colors (using Paletton tool), navigation, and hover effects
    </li>
</ul>
