# Comp 2909 BCIT
## AngularJS Assignment 3


### To demo this assignment, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo into new project folder.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/vinay30/angular-a3.git  punwani-assign-3
cd punwani-assign-3
```


2. Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

>Doesn't work in _Bash for Windows_ which does not support servers as of January, 2017.

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

### Modifications

Feel free to create a new branch and extend the demo with additional functionality, then create a PR so I can check it out!
